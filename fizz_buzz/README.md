#Fizz Buzz

###Background
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

Fizz buzz has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability. FizzBuzz is also a popular Kata in the software craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will use exercises, often similar to this one, called 'Kata' repeatedly, often daily, in order to practice their craft, much like a soldier, a musician, a doctor or a dancer would repeat exercises or movements to practice theirs.

###Rules
Create a program that will count replacing numbers divisible by three with the word "fizz", numbers divisible by five with the word "buzz", numbers divisible by three and five with the word "fizzbuzz". You can output using console.log, or return an array, or whatever it's up to you.
